# Team4FinalProject

## FLIP OR FLOP?

#### Topic

Ali-Express is an e-commerce site that is similar to Amazon, Inc. It sells various products from Men's and Woman's fashion, to electronics and toys.
Some members of our team have personal experience using this site and felt like it was a coinflip as to whether the product would good enough to buy
(flip) or low quality (flop).  The shipping times for the products varied greatly too.  Some products would arrive in a few days, while some would
arrive SIX months after the fact.


#### Purpose of project

The purpose of our project is to use the Ali-Express API  to determine whether or not the product you are looking to buy are in fact a good 
product.  We will use the data from our API to create a database and machine learning to determine whether or not the product is worth
purchasing.

#### Programs used

The programs we will be using are PySpark, CoLAb, Postgres SQL, the AliExpress API and Amazon AWS.  We will display our presentation using Tableu
stories and potentially will create an interactive HTML site (using HTML, CSS and Java Script) that will let you select the product and easily see
it's attributes.
