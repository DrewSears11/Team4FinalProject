# Team4FinalProject

## FLIP OR FLOP?

#### Topic

Ali-Express is an e-commerce site that is similar to Amazon, Inc. It sells various products from Men's and Woman's fashion, to electronics and toys.
Some members of our team have personal experience using this site and felt like it was a coinflip as to whether the product would good enough to buy
(flip) or low quality (flop).  The shipping times for the products varied greatly too.  Some products would arrive in a few days, while some would
arrive SIX months after the fact.


#### Purpose of project

The purpose of our project is to use the Ali-Express API  to determine whether or not the product you are looking to buy are in fact a good 
product.  We will use the data from our API to create a database and machine learning to determine whether or not the product is worth
purchasing.

#### Programs used

The programs we will be using are PySpark, CoLAb, Postgres SQL, the AliExpress API and Amazon AWS.  We will display our presentation using Tableu
stories and potentially will create an interactive HTML site (using HTML, CSS and Java Script) that will let you select the product and easily see
it's attributes.

#### Machine Learning Module

The machine learning model we will be using is the Naive-Bayes model, a supervised machine learning classifier. Leading up to the model, we will use Natural Language Processing to analyze feedback from the AliExpress API and classify products as positively reviewed or negatively reviewed. The Natural Language Processing model pipeline will work through tokenization, stop words filtering, TF-IDF, and setting up the pipeline. Finally, the Naive-Bayes model will classify the accuracy of the Natural Language Processing pipeline. A mockup of the model is included. 

#### Database

Provisional Machine Learning module that will stand in for the final machine learning model.

#### Process
The database was created by initially calling Ali Express APIs for the women's shoes, women's boots, women's flats, and men's shoes categories. Product IDs were pulled from those groups then used to pull the product feedback for each product. 

#### Communication Protocols and Roles

- Drew is the square role
- Noor is the triangle role
- Wilfred is the circle role
- Raquel is the X role

The team will communicate three times a week on Monday, Wednesday, and Sunday evenings to report their progress and any issues they have encountered.ed.
Team can communicate more this is just the bare minimum needed to stay on task.
